React (sometimes styled React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript library[2] for building user interfaces.
It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations.[3][4][5] According to JavaScript analytics service Libscore, React is currently being used on the websites of Netflix, Imgur, Buffer, Bleacher Report, Feedly, Airbnb, SeatGeek, HelloSign, Walmart, and others.[6]
React allows developers to create large web applications that use data which can change over time, without reloading the page. Its main goal is to be fast, simple and scalable. React processes only user interfaces in applications. This corresponds to View in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) template, and can be used in combination with other JavaScript libraries or frameworks in MVC, such as AngularJS.[7]

History[edit]
React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP.[8] It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012.[9] It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013. React Native, which enables native iOS, Android and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React.js Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015. On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new core algorithm of React framework library for building user interfaces.[10] React Fiber will become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React framework.[11]
Notable features[edit]
One-way data flow[edit]
Properties, a set of immutable values, are passed to a component's renderer as properties in its HTML tag. A component cannot directly modify any properties passed to it, but can be passed callback functions that do modify values. This mechanism's promise is expressed as "properties flow down; actions flow up".
Virtual DOM[edit]
Another notable feature is the use of a "virtual Document Object Model," or "virtual DOM." React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and then updates the browser's displayed DOM efficiently.[12] This allows the programmer to write code as if the entire page is rendered on each change while the React libraries only render subcomponents that actually change.
JSX[edit]
React components are typically written in JSX, a JavaScript extension syntax allowing quoting of HTML and using HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents.[13] This is a React-specific grammar extension to JavaScript like now defunct E4X. HTML syntax is processed into JavaScript calls of the React framework. Developers may also write in pure JavaScript. JSX is similar to another extension syntax created by Facebook for PHP, XHP. JSX looks like regular HTML. An example of JSX code -


import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
   render() {
      return (
         <div>
               <p>Header</p>
               <p>Content</p>
               <p>Footer</p>
         </div>
      );
   }
}

export default App;

Even though it is similar to HTML, there are certain aspects you need to keep in mind when working with JSX.
Nested Elements
If you want to return more elements you will need to wrap it in a single container element like the
element shown above.
Attributes
You can add your own custom attributes in addition to HTML attributes. The custom attributes need to be added with 'data-' prefix
Javascript Expressions
Javascript expressions can be used inside JSX with curly brackets {}


import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
   render() {
      return (
         <div>
            <h1>{10+1}</h1>
         </div>
      );
   }
}

export default App;

The example above will render 11.
Ternary Operators
We cannot use if else statements inside JSX but we can use ternary expressions instead. In example below browser will render 'true' because i is equal to 1.


import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
    render(){
      var i = 1;
      return (
         <div>
            <h1>{ i === 1 ? 'true' : 'false' }</h1>
         </div>
      );
   }
}

export default App;






This section needs expansion with: JSX syntax is very different than normal JavaScript, some examples should be provided, or a new article created with in-depth technical detail on how it works, how it compiles, etc.... You can help by adding to it. (May 2017)


Architecture beyond HTML[edit]
The basic architecture of React applies beyond rendering HTML in the browser. For example, Facebook has dynamic charts that render to <canvas> tags,[14] and Netflix and PayPal use isomorphic loading to render identical HTML on both the server and client.[15][16]
React Native[edit]
React Native libraries were announced by Facebook in 2015,[17] providing the React architecture to native iOS, Android and UWP[18] applications.
Future development[edit]
Project status can be tracked via the core team discussion forum.[19] However major changes to React go through the Future of React repo, Issues and PR.[20][21] This enables the React community to provide feedback on new potential features, experimental APIs and JavaScript syntax improvements.
Sub projects[edit]
The status of the React sub-projects used to be available in the project wiki.[22]
Facebook CLA[edit]
Facebook requires contributors to React to sign the Facebook CLA.[23][24]
Licensing[edit]
The initial public release of React in May 2013 used a standard Apache License 2.0. In October 2014, React 0.12.0 replaced this with a 3-clause BSD license and added a separate PATENTS text file that permits usage of any Facebook patents related to the software:[25]

"The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice, for anyone that makes any claim (including by filing any lawsuit, assertion or other action) alleging (a) direct, indirect, or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent: (i) by Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether or not such claim is related to the Software, (ii) by any party if such claim arises in whole or in part from any software, product or service of Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether or not such claim is related to the Software, or (iii) by any party relating to the Software; or (b) that any right in any patent claim of Facebook is invalid or unenforceable."

This unconventional clause caused some controversy and debate in the React user community, because it could be interpreted to empower Facebook to revoke the license in many scenarios, for example if Facebook sues the licensee prompting them to take "other action" by publishing the action on a blog or elsewhere. Many expressed concerns that Facebook could unfairly exploit the termination clause or that integrating React into a product might complicate a startup company's future acquisition.[26]
Based on community feedback, Facebook updated the patent grant in April 2015 to be less ambiguous and more permissive:[27]

"The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice, if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent Assertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or in part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating to the Software. [...] A "Patent Assertion" is any lawsuit or other action alleging direct, indirect, or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent, including a cross-claim or counterclaim."[28]

This second version of the patent grant remains controversial, making use of the framework unacceptable for some developers. This is because the document continues to allow Facebook to revoke the right to use the framework under Facebook patents in the event that the licensee brings a patent lawsuit against Facebook.[29]

</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_liked_YouTube_videos" target="_blank">List of most liked YouTube videos</a></td><td>



Wiz Khalifa performing in Toronto in July 2016. "See You Again" has been the most liked video on YouTube since August 2016, with over 14.8 million likes as of June 1, 2017.


This list of most liked YouTube videos contains the top 40 videos with the most likes of all time, as derived from YouTube charts.[1] The like count is taken directly from the page of the video itself. YouTube implemented a like and dislike button on these pages in March 2010, part of a major redesign of the site. This served as a replacement for their five-star rating system;[2] YouTube's designers found the previous system ineffective because the options to rate a video between two and four stars were rarely selected.[3] Of the 40 videos in this list, 35 also appear in the list of most viewed YouTube videos and 15 appear in the list of most disliked YouTube videos. All videos in this list are music videos.
The music video for LMFAO's song "Party Rock Anthem" stood as the most liked video on YouTube in 2012, with 1.56 million likes, until the video for Psy's "Gangnam Style" surpassed it in September that year, yielding more than 1.57 million likes.[4] Following this accomplishment, "Gangnam Style" entered the Guinness World Records book as the most liked video on YouTube and on the Internet as of 2012.[5] Psy's video remained the most liked on YouTube for nearly four years until August 27, 2016, when Wiz Khalifa's "See You Again" featuring Charlie Puth surpassed it with 11.21 million likes. Currently, among the videos that meet the criteria for making the list, "Faded" by Alan Walker holds the highest like to dislike ratio. As of June 2017, only 3 non-music videos are in the 100 most liked videos list, including videos by PewDiePie, whinderssonnunes and YouTube Spotlight.
As of June 2017, Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift each have three videos in the top 40. Katy Perry, Eminem, Fifth Harmony, Twenty One Pilots and Ed Sheeran each have two of their videos in the top 40.[1]

Play is an open source web application framework, written in Scala and also usable from e.g. Java (Play includes a Java API in more recent versions), which follows the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It aims to optimize developer productivity by using convention over configuration, hot code reloading and display of errors in the browser.[2]
Support for the Scala programming language has been available since version 1.1 of the framework.[3] In version 2.0, the framework core was rewritten in Scala. Build and deployment was migrated to SBT, and templates use Scala instead of Groovy.
Versions above 2.5 requires the Java 8 JVM.

History[edit]
Play was created by software developer Guillaume Bort, while working at Zengularity SA (formerly Zenexity).[4] Although the early releases are no longer available online, there is evidence of Play existing as far back as May 2007.[5] In 2007 pre-release versions of the project were available to download from Zenexity's website.[6]
In May 2008 the first published code for 1.0 appeared on Launchpad.[7] This was followed by a full 1.0 release in October 2009.[8]
Play 1.1 was released in November 2010 after a move from Launchpad to GitHub. It included a migration from Apache MINA to JBoss Netty, Scala support, native GlassFish container, an asynchronous web services library, OAuth support, HTTPS support and other features.[9]
Play 1.2 was released in April 2011. It included dependency management with Apache Ivy, support for WebSocket, integrated database migration (reversion was not implemented[10]), a switch to the H2 database as the default development database and other features.[11]
Sadek Drobi joined Guillaume Bort late 2011 to create Play 2.0 which was released on March 13, 2012[12] in conjunction with Typesafe Stack 2.0.[13]
Play 2.1 was released on February 6, 2013, upgraded to Scala 2.10 and introduced, among other new features, modularization, a new JSON API, filters and RequireJS support.[14]
Play 2.2 was released on September 20, 2013. Upgraded support for SBT to 0.13, better support for buffering, built in support for gzip and new stage and dist tasks with support for native packaging on several platforms such as OS X (DMG), Linux (RPM, DEB), and Windows (MSI) as well as zip files.
Play 2.3 was released on May 30, 2014, introducing the Activator command, better tooling for static assets, support for Java 8 and Scala 2.11, better performance, Web Service enhancement and support to integrate Actors and Web Sockets.
Play 2.4 was released on May 26, 2015 with Dependency injection out of the box, the possibility to embed Play inside other applications, improved Java 8 support, HikariCP as the default connection pool and better testing APIs.
Play 2.5 was released March 29, 2016 and switched from Iteratees to Akka Streams for all asynchronous IO and streaming, replaced custom functional types with Java 8 types (such as CompletionStage and Optional), introduced equivalent Java APIs for features that previously only existing in the Scala API, such as implementing filters and custom body parsers and with a 20% performance increase.
Motivation[edit]
Play is heavily inspired by ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails and Django and is similar to this family of frameworks. Play web applications can be written in Scala or Java, in an environment that may be less Java Enterprise Edition-centric. Play uses no Java EE constraints. This can make Play simpler to develop compared to other Java-centric platforms.[15]
Although Play applications are designed to be run using the built-in Netty or Akka-HTTP web server, they can also be packaged as WAR files to be distributed to standard Java EE application servers.[16]
Major differences from Java frameworks[edit]

Stateless: Play 2 is fully RESTful – there is no Java EE session per connection.
Integrated unit testing: JUnit and Selenium support is included in the core.
API comes with most required elements built-in.
Asynchronous I/O: due to using JBoss Netty as its web server, Play can service long requests asynchronously rather than tying up HTTP threads doing business logic like Java EE frameworks that don't use the asynchronous support offered by Servlet 3.0.[17]
Modular architecture: like Ruby on Rails and Django, Play comes with the concept of modules.
Native Scala support: Play 2 uses Scala internally, but also exposes both a Scala API, and a Java API that is deliberately slightly different to fit in with Java conventions, and Play is completely interoperable with Java.

Components[edit]
Play 2.5.x makes use of several popular Java libraries:

Netty or Akka-HTTP for the web server
Akka Streams for all asynchronous IO and streaming
No required ORM, but Anorm (Scala), Slick (Scala) and Ebean (Java) are included for database access
Twirl (Scala) as the template engine
Built in hot-reloading
sbt as the build tool and for dependency management

The following functionality is present in the core:

a clean, RESTful framework
CRUD: a module to simplify editing of model objects
Secure: a module to enable simple user authentication
a validation framework based on annotations
JSON and XML parsers and marshallers
a persistence layer based on JPA
an embedded database for quick deployment/testing purposes
a full embedded testing framework
an automatic file uploads functionality
multi-environment configuration awareness
a modular architecture, which enables bringing new features in the core easily
OpenID and web services clients

Testing framework[edit]
Play provides integration with test frameworks for unit testing and functional testing for both Scala and Java applications. For Scala, integrations with Scalatest and Specs2 are provided out-of-the-box and, for Java, there is integration with JUnit 4. For both languages, there is also integration with Selenium (software). SBT is used to run the tests and also to generate reports. It is also possible to use code coverage tools by using sbt plugins such as scoverage or jacoco4sbt.
Usage[edit]
The mailing list for the project has over 13,000 subscribers.[18] It is used in various projects such as local governments, company intranets, mobile web sites and Open Source projects.
As of October 2013[update], the Play Framework is the most popular Scala project on GitHub.[19] In July 2015, Play was the 3rd most popular Scala library in Github, based on 64,562 Libraries. 21.3% of the top Scala projects used Play as their framework of choice.[20]

Backbone.js is a JavaScript framework with a RESTful JSON interface and is based on the model–view–presenter (MVP) application design paradigm. Backbone is known for being lightweight, as its only hard dependency is on one JavaScript library,[2] Underscore.js, plus jQuery for use of the full library.[3] It is designed for developing single-page web applications,[4] and for keeping various parts of web applications (e.g. multiple clients and the server) synchronized.[5] Backbone was created by Jeremy Ashkenas,[6] who is also known for CoffeeScript and Underscore.js.[7]
When handling the DOM Backbone.js adopts an imperative programming style, in contrast with a declarative programming style (common in Angular.js using data-attributes). "Backbone should continue to be a tool that gives you the freedom to design the full experience of your web application." [8]
Trying to provide "the minimal set of data-structuring (models and collections) and user interface (views and URLs)" [9], leaves to the developer the choice of extensions for enhanced functionality:

nested views (Backbone Layout Manager)
model-view binding (ReSTbasis)

Facebook structure[edit]
News Feed[edit]
Main article: News Feed
The news feed is the primary system through which users are exposed to content posted on the network. Using a secret method (initially known as EdgeRank), Facebook selects a handful updates to actually show users every time they visit their feed, out of an average of 1500 updates they can potentially receive.[1][2]
On September 6, 2006, Ruchi Sanghvi announced a new home page feature called News Feed. Originally, when users logged into Facebook, they were presented with a customizable version of their own profile. The new layout, by contrast, created an alternative home page in which users saw a constantly updated list of their friends' Facebook activity. News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays, among other updates. This has enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user's friends. An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini Feed, a news stream on the user's profile page that shows updates about that user. Unlike in the News Feed, the user can delete events from the Mini Feed after they appear so that they are no longer visible to profile visitors. In 2011 Facebook updated the News Feed to show top stories and most recent stories in one feed, and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories, as well as to un-highlight stories. In response to users' criticism, Facebook later updated the News Feed to allow users to view recent stories first.
Initially, the addition of the News Feed caused some discontent among Facebook users. Many users complained that the News Feed was too cluttered with excess information. Others were concerned that the News Feed made it too easy for other people to track activities like changes in relationship status, events, and conversations with other users. This tracking is often casually referred to as "Facebook-Stalking". In response to this dissatisfaction, creator Mark Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Thereafter, users were able to control what types of information were shared automatically with friends. Currently, users may prevent friends from seeing updates about several types of especially private activities, although other events are not customizable in this way.
With the introduction of the "New Facebook" in early February 2010 came a complete redesign of the pages, several new features and changes to News Feeds. On their personal Feeds (now integrated with Walls), users were given the option of removing updates from any application as well as choosing the size they show up on the page. Furthermore, the community feed (containing recent actions by the user's friends) contained options to instantly select whether to hear more or less about certain friends or applications.
On March 7, 2013, Facebook has announced a redesigned newsfeed.
Friends[edit]
See also: Friending
"Friending" someone is the act of sending another user a friend request on Facebook. The two people are Facebook friends once the receiving party accepts the friend request. In addition to accepting the request, the user has the option of declining the friend request or hiding it using the "Not Now" feature. Deleting a friend request removes the request, but does allow the sender to resend it in the future. The "Not Now" feature hides the request but does not delete it, allowing the receiver to revisit the request at a later date.
It is also possible to remove a user from one's friends, which is referred to as "unfriending" by Facebook.[3] Many Facebook users also refer to the process as "de-friending".[4] "Unfriend" was New Oxford American Dictionary's word of the year in 2009.[5][6] Facebook does not notify a user if they have been unfriended, but there are scripts[7] that provide this functionality. There has also been a study on why Facebook users unfriend, which found that differences, especially between ages, and few mutual friendships were the dominant factors correlated with unfriending, all of which mirrors the decline of physical-world relationships.[8]
Facebook profiles also have advanced privacy features to restrict content to certain users, such as non-friends or persons on a specific list.
Wall[edit]
The Wall is the original profile space where Facebook users' content until December 2011 was displayed. It allowed the posting of messages, often short or temporal notes, for the user to see while displaying the time and date the message was written. A user's Wall is visible to anyone with the ability to see his or her full profile, and friends' Wall posts appear in the user's News Feed.
In July 2007, Facebook allowed users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas previously the Wall was limited to text only.[9] In May 2008, the Wall-to-Wall for each profile was limited to only 40 posts. Facebook later allowed users to insert HTML code in boxes attached to the wall via apps like Static FBML which has allowed marketers to track use of their fan pages with Google Analytics.
The concept of tagging in status updates, an attempt to imitate Twitter,[10] began September 14, 2009. This meant putting the name of a user, a brand, an event or a group[11] in a post in such a way that it linked to the wall of the Facebook page being tagged, and made the post appear in news feeds for that page, as well as those of selected friends.[12] This was first done using the "@" symbol followed by the person's name. Later, a numerical ID for the person could be used.[13] Early in 2011, tagging in comments was added.
In addition to postings by other users, the Wall also displayed other events that happened to the user's profile. This included when information was changed, when they changed their profile picture, and when they connected with new people, among other things.
The Wall has been replaced by the Timeline profile layout, which was introduced in December 2011.
Timeline[edit]
Since December 15, 2011, a Timeline is the new virtual space in which all the content of Facebook users is organized and shown.[14] Replacing the Wall, in a Timeline the photos, videos, and posts of any given user are categorized according to the period of time in which they were uploaded or created.[14] Posts and events are displayed along a timeline that runs through the center of the profile, with the option of adding events that occurred prior to the user joining Facebook as well as "hiding" posts.[15] Some experts saw this as a crucial step on the use of social networks.[16] In March 2012, Timeline became available for "Facebook Pages", and by the end of the month, Facebook had forced all Facebook Pages (not Profile pages) to convert to the Timeline layout, against the will of many page admins. Like the Wall, users can set Timeline privacy settings to change who can see their entire profile. Users' friends have the ability to post messages on the user's Timeline. Using Facebook on certain devices, such as iPads, may result in automatic adoption of the Timeline. In August 2012, Profile pages were forced to change to the Timeline layout.
Likes and Reactions[edit]
Main article: Facebook like button




The "like" button on Facebook.


The like button, first enabled on February 9, 2009,[17] enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos, links shared by friends, and advertisements. Once clicked by a user, the designated content appears in the News Feeds of that user's friends,[18][19] and the button also displays the number of other users who have liked the content, including a full or partial list of those users.[20] The like button was extended to comments in June 2010.[21] After extensive testing[22] and years of questions from the public about whether it had an intention to incorporate a "Dislike" button,[23] Facebook officially rolled out "Reactions" to users worldwide on February 24, 2016, letting users long-press on the like button for an option to use one of five pre-defined emotions, including "Love", "Haha", "Wow", "Sad", or "Angry".[22][24] Reactions were also extended to comments in May 2017.[25][26]
Messages and inbox[edit]
Main article: Facebook Messenger
Facebook Messenger is an instant messaging service and software application. Originally developed as Facebook Chat in 2008,[27] the company revamped its messaging service in 2010,[28] and subsequently released standalone iOS and Android apps in August 2011.[29] Over the years, Facebook has released new apps on a variety of different operating systems,[30][31][32] launched a dedicated website interface,[33] and separated the messaging functionality from the main Facebook app, requiring users to download the standalone apps.[34]
Facebook Messenger lets Facebook users send messages to each other. Complementing regular conversations, Messenger lets users make voice calls[35] and video calls[36] both in one-to-one interactions[37] and in group conversations.[38] Its Android app has integrated support for SMS[39] and "Chat Heads", which are round profile photo icons appearing on-screen regardless of what app is open,[40] while both apps support multiple accounts,[41] conversations with optional end-to-end encryption,[42] and playing "Instant Games", which are select games built into Messenger.[43] Some features, including sending money[44] and requesting transportation,[45] are limited to the United States.[44] In 2017, Facebook has added "Messenger Day", a feature that lets users share photos and videos in a story-format with all their friends with the content disappearing after 24 hours;[46] Reactions, which lets users tap and hold a message to add a reaction through an emoji;[47] and Mentions, which lets users in group conversations type @ to give a particular user a notification.[47]
In March 2015, Facebook announced that it would start letting businesses and users interact through Messenger with features such as tracking purchases and receiving notifications, and interacting with customer service representatives. It also announced that third-party developers could integrate their apps into Messenger, letting users enter an app while inside Messenger and optionally share details from the app into a chat.[48] In April 2016, it introduced an API for developers to build chatbots into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to give users news through the service,[49] and in April 2017, it enabled the M virtual assistant for users in the U.S., which scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money.[50][51] Additionally, Facebook expanded the use of bots, incorporating group chatbots into Messenger as "Chat Extensions", adding a "Discovery" tab for finding bots, and enabling special, branded QR codes that, when scanned, take the user to a specific bot.[52]
Notifications[edit]
Notifications tell the user that something has been added to his or her profile page. Examples include: a message being shared on the user's wall or a comment on a picture of the user or on a picture that the user has previously commented on. Initially, notifications for events were limited to one per event; these were eventually grouped category wise. For instance, 10 users having liked a user's picture now count for one notification, whereas in the earlier stages, these would have accounted for ten separate notifications. The number of notifications can be changed in the settings section, to a maximum of 99. There is a red notification counter at the top of the page, which if clicked displays the most recent ones.
Groups[edit]
Facebook Groups can be created by individual users. Groups allow members to post content such as links, media, questions, events, editable documents, and comments on these items.
Groups are used for collaboration and allow discussions, events, and numerous other activities. They are a way of enabling a number of people to come together online to share information and discuss specific subjects. They are increasingly used by clubs, companies and public sector organizations to engage with stakeholders, be they members of the public, employees, members, service users, shareholders or customers. Groups can have three different levels of privacy settings:

"Open" means both the group, its members and their comments are visible to the public (which includes non-members) but they cannot interact without joining.
"Closed" means the group and its members are visible to the public but their comments are not visible until the user has joined the group.
"Secret" means that nothing can be viewed by the public unless a member specifically invites another user to join the group.[53]

Previously, in October 2010, there were version 0 (legacy) and version 1 (current) groups.[54] Version 1 or "new" groups can contain the name of the group in their URL if the email-address of the group is set. Groups do not have a RSS feed to export the wall or the member list, such as Pages or Events have, but third parties provide such service if the group is set to an "open" privacy setting. All groups have since been migrated to a single design.[55]
Applications[edit]
Events[edit]
Facebook events are a way for members to let friends know about upcoming events in their community and to organize social gatherings. Events require an event name, network, host name, event type, start time, location, and a guest list of friends invited. Events can be public or private. Private events cannot be found in searches and are by invitation only. People who have not been invited cannot view a Private event's description, Wall, or photos. They also will not see any Feed stories about the event. When setting up an event the user can choose to allow friends to upload photos or videos. Note that unlike real world events, all events are treated as separate entities (when the reality is some events sit inside other events, going to one event would preclude going to another, and so on).
In February 2011, Facebook began to use the hCalendar microformat to mark up events, and the hCard microformat for the events' venues, enabling the extraction of details to users' own calendar or mapping applications. Third parties facilitate events to be exported from Facebook Pages to the iCalendar-format.[56]
Marketplace[edit]
In May 2007, Facebook introduced the Facebook Marketplace allowing users to post free classified ads within the following categories: For Sale, Housing, Jobs, and Other. Ads can be posted in either available or wanted format.[57] The market place is available for all Facebook users and is currently free.[58] In 2009 Facebook transferred ownership of the Marketplace to Oodle.[59] The original Marketplace was shut down in November 2014.[60]
Notes[edit]
Facebook Notes was introduced on August 22, 2006, a blogging feature that allowed tags and embeddable images. Users were later able to import blogs from Xanga, LiveJournal, Blogger, and other blogging services.[61]
A use of Notes includes the Internet meme "25 Random Things About Me" which involves writing 25 things about the user that their friends do not already know about them and using the tag function to ask 25 friends to also do so. Nearly five million "25 Random Things" notes were written on Facebook profiles in the first week of February 2009.[62]
Places[edit]
Facebook announced Places on August 18, 2010. It is a feature that lets users check into Facebook using a mobile device to let a user's friends know where they are at the moment.[63]
In November 2010, Facebook announced "Deals", a subset of the Places offering, which allows for users to check in from restaurants, supermarkets, bars, and coffee shops using an app on a mobile device and then be rewarded discounts, coupons, and free merchandise. This feature is marketed as a digital version of a loyalty card or coupon where a customer gets rewarded for loyal buying behavior.[64]
On October 10, 2010, Places became available on BlackBerry,[65] iPhone, and Android. Other users, including Windows Mobile users, must use an HTML5 browser to use Places via Facebook Touch Site.[66]
Facebook Places was reported discontinued on August 24, 2011,[67] but was relaunched in November 2014, now including cover images, discovery sections, city/category landing pages, a deeper integration with the Location API, Graph Search queries and user generated content.[68]
Platform[edit]
Main article: Facebook Platform
The Facebook Platform provides a set of APIs and tools which enable third-party developers to integrate with the "open graph", whether through applications on Facebook.com or external websites and devices. Launched on May 24, 2007, Facebook Platform has evolved from enabling development just on Facebook.com to one also supporting integration across the web and devices.
Facebook Platform Statistics as of May 2010:

More than one million developers and entrepreneurs from more than 180 countries
More than 550,000 active applications currently on Facebook Platform
Every month, more than 70% of Facebook users engage with Platform applications
More than 250,000 websites have integrated with Facebook Platform
More than 100 million Facebook users engage with Facebook on external websites every month

Third party companies such as Adonomics, Kontagent, and Mixpanel provide application metrics, and blogs such as AppRate, Inside Facebook, and Face Reviews have sprung up in response to the clamor for Facebook applications. On July 4, 2007, Altura Ventures announced the "Altura 1 Facebook Investment Fund", becoming the world's first Facebook-only venture capital firm.
On August 29, 2007, Facebook changed the way in which the popularity of applications is measured, to give attention to the more engaging applications, following criticism that ranking applications only by the number of people who had installed the application was giving an advantage to the highly viral, yet useless applications. Tech blog Valleywag has criticized Facebook Applications, labeling them a "cornucopia of uselessness". Others have called for limiting third-party applications so the Facebook "user experience" is not degraded.
Primarily attempting to create viral applications is a method that has certainly been employed by numerous Facebook application developers. Stanford University even offered a class in the Fall of 2007, entitled, Computer Science (CS) 377W: "Create Engaging Web Applications Using Metrics and Learning on Facebook". Numerous applications created by the class were highly successful, and ranked amongst the top Facebook applications, with some achieving over 3.5 million users in a month.
Facebook Questions[edit]
In May 2010, Facebook began testing Questions, which is expected to compete with services such as Yahoo! Answers.[69]
On March 24, 2011, Facebook announced that its new product, Facebook Questions, facilitates short, poll-like answers in addition to long-form responses, and also links directly to relevant items in Facebook's directory of "fan pages".[70]
Photos[edit]
One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the Photos application, where users can upload albums of photos, tag friends helped by facial recognition technology,[71] and comment on photos. According to Facebook:

50+ billion user photos (as of July 2010)[72]
More than 1.5 petabytes (1.5 million gigabytes) of photo storage used (as of May 2009)[73]
220 million photos added each week which take up 25 terabytes of disk space (as of May 2009)
3+ billion photo images served to users every day (as of May 2007)[74]
550,000+ images served per second during peak traffic windows (as of May 2009)

On April 11, 2011, Facebook launched a new feature for photo tagging: people can tag photos with a brand, product, company or person's Facebook page, similar to the way they tag their friends in photos.[75] In August 2011, Facebook announced that it would be adding a series of photo filters to its mobile application.[76] Facebook plans to unveil nearly a dozen photo filters, which will be similar to Instagram's grainy images.[76] Per last known numbers, today in the world, highest number of photos are hosted at Facebook.
Videos[edit]
During the time that Facebook released its platform, it also released an application of its own for sharing videos on Facebook.[77] Users can add their videos with the service by uploading video, adding video through Facebook Mobile, and using a webcam recording feature. Additionally, users can "tag" their friends in videos they add much like the way users can tag their friends in photos, except the location of the friend in the video is not displayed. Users also have the option of video messaging. Videos cannot be placed in categories, whereas photos are sorted by albums. Facebook Video can support up to 1080p format and even 4K resolution.
User can now add all the videos in one playlist like that of YouTube.[78] This facility was started in January 2015.
Facebook Paper[edit]
During the same week as its tenth anniversary, Facebook launched the Paper iPhone app. The app consists of two major features: Firstly, Facebook’s News Feed is more graphic, as the app uses technology such as full-screen photos and video footage. Content is organized under headings such as “Creators” and “Planet”; secondly, Paper allows users to post statuses, photos, and “stories” to Facebook that has been described as a different, more presentation-focused design.[79]
Facebook Mentions[edit]
Facebook Mentions is an app released by Facebook in 2014. The app allows public figures with verified accounts to upload content more easily.[80]
General features[edit]
Facebook dynamic text/type[edit]
In November 2015 Facebook made changes to their text-only status update on Timeline to allow for adjustable text sizes (dynamic text) on mobile apps.[81]
Credits[edit]
Main article: Facebook Credits
Facebook Credits are a virtual currency users can use to buy gifts, and virtual goods in many games and applications on the Facebook platform. As of July 2010, users of Facebook can purchase Facebook credits in Australian Dollars, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Danish krone, Euro, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Swiss franc, Turkish lira, US Dollars, and Venezuelan Bolivar. Facebook credits can be used on many popular games such as Happy Aquarium, Happy Island, Zoo Paradise, Happy Pets, Hello City, It Girl, FarmVille, and Mafia Wars.[82]
Feature phones[edit]
Although like all other website apps Facebook made its presence on the smartphones as mentioned but also is present for the feature phones. As the company said that the feature phones dominate the American cell phone markets hence an app was exclusively made for this purpose as well.[83]
Graph Search[edit]
Main article: Facebook Graph Search
Released in July 2013, Graph Search allows users to search within their network of friends for answers to natural language questions such as, "Movies my friends who like The Hobbit liked" and receive direct answers, rather than the list of websites that search engines usually provide.[84][85]
IPv6[edit]
According to a June 2010 report by Network World, Facebook said that it was offering "experimental, non-production" support for IPv6, the long-anticipated upgrade to the Internet's main communications protocol. The news about Facebook's IPv6 support was expected; Facebook told Network World in February 2010, that it planned to support native IPv6 user requests "by the midpoint of this year".[86]
In a presentation at the Google IPv6 Implementors Conference, Facebook's network engineers said it was "easy to make [the] site available on v6". Facebook said it deployed dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 support on its routers, and that it made no changes to its hosts in order to support IPv6. Facebook also said it was supporting an emerging encapsulation mechanism known as Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP), which separates Internet addresses from endpoint identifiers to improve the scalability of IPv6 deployments. "Facebook was the first major Web site on LISP (v4 and v6)", Facebook engineers said during their presentation.[citation needed] Facebook said that using LISP allowed them to deploy IPv6 services quickly with no extra cost. Facebook's IPv6 services are available at www.v6.facebook.com m.v6.facebook.com, www.lisp6.facebook.com and m.lisp6.facebook.com.[86] In addition, Facebook enabled IPv6 on its main domain names during World IPv6 Launch.
Listen with Friends[edit]
Listen with Friends allows Facebook users to listen to music and discuss the tunes using Facebook Chat with friends at the same time. Users can also listen in as a group while one friend acts as a DJ. Up to 50 friends can listen to the same song at the same time, and chat about it. Every time a user begins listening to music with a friend, a "story will be posted to her/his friends" ticker and/or news feed. Users will have control over who will be able to see when they are listening with a friend through their App Settings page after installing the compatible music app.[87] This feature was initially supported through Audizer.com, but as of August 2012, services were discontinued and the Facebook / Audizer splash page has been redirected to Facebook.com.[88]
Live streaming[edit]
In August 2015, Facebook launched the ability for verified VIP users to broadcast live video streams using the Facebook Mentions app. Streams appear on the News Feed, and users can comment on them in real-time. Live broadcasts are automatically saved as a video post to the streamer's page. The feature was positioned as a competitor to services such as Meerkat and Periscope.[89] Live streaming began to roll out for public use in January 2016, beginning with the Facebook iOS app in the United States.[90][91] In April 2016, Facebook unveiled a live streaming API, aimed to allow other devices such as professional video cameras and drones to integrate with the live video streaming platform.[92] Facebook also updated its mobile app to provide a dedicated section for showcasing current and recent live broadcasts.[93]
To drive its adoption, Facebook provided incentives to publishers and celebrities to perform live broadcasts, including monetary rewards.[94][95] Brands and channels have used live streaming to reach new larger audiences. [96] Brand videos aimed directly at the Facebook Live platform have been generally less professional than other content.
Since January 2017 Facebook Live has been available for Laptops by logging on to Facebook via Google Chrome. [96]
Mood faces[edit]
Facebook chat supports numerous emoticons, like (^^^) for a shark. Recently, it has also become possible to post larger, animated images through Facebook's built in emotion system.

At one time, entering the Konami Code followed by Enter at the home page caused a lensflare-style series of circles to display when clicking, typing, or scrolling.[97]
Asking "how is babby formed?" with the Questions feature released September 23, 2010, will Rickroll the user.
A user can change his/her language to Leet Speak, Pirate language, and upside down English.
Entering @[x:y] resolves a user's name, where x is a positive integer and y is 0 or 1. For example, @[4:0] resolves to "Mark Zuckerberg".

Phone[edit]
At an event in April 2013, Mark Zuckerberg announced a new Android-based "Home" feature, which would show content from users' Facebook pages on the home page of their mobile phones, without having to open an app.[98]
Poke[edit]
The poke feature is intended to be a poke gesture (similar to "nudge" in instant messaging) to attract the attention of another user.[99] A previous version of Facebook's FAQ gave additional insight into the origin of the feature, stating:

When we created the poke, we thought it would be cool to have a feature without any specific purpose. People interpret the poke in many different ways, and we encourage you to come up with your own meanings.
— Mark Zuckerberg during a live Facebook webinar

There are several applications on Facebook which extend the idea of the poke feature by allowing users to perform other actions to their friends—such as "kick" or "wave to".
Smartphone integration[edit]
Many smartphones offer access to the Facebook services either through their web browsers or applications. The Facebook iPhone-compatible web site was launched August 2007 and as of July 2008 over 1.5 million people used it regularly, at the point when a free application for the iOS named "Facebook for iPhone" was launched.[100] Version 2.0 of this app was released in September 2008 and featured improved services such as being able to respond to friend requests and notifications.[101] Version 3.0 was released in August 2009 and added features such as events, and uploading video with an iPhone 3GS.[102][103]
Microsoft developed an application for Facebook on their Windows Phone 7 platform, available in the Windows Phone Marketplace. Users can pin elements such as Messages, Events, the News Feed, and Photos directly onto one's homescreen. It also includes tile notifications for events, friend requests, tags, and so on.[104] Windows Mobile platform, including features such as messaging, uploading pictures and video straight from the device, managing profile information, contact integration allowing users to call anyone in their friends list that has their number in their profile information. It is also possible to add a chat feature to Windows Mobile via third-party software such as FIM, available in the Windows Mobile Marketplace. Nokia also offers a Facebook app on its Ovi Store for Nokia S60 devices such as the N97, with most of the functionality of the full website.[105]
Google's Android 2.0 OS automatically includes an official Facebook app. The first device to use this is the Motorola Droid. The app has options to sync Facebook friends with contacts, which adds profile pictures and status updates to the contacts list. Research In Motion also offers a Facebook application for the BlackBerry. Functions include an ability to integrate Facebook events into the BlackBerry calendar, and using Facebook profile pictures for Caller ID.[106]
"Status updates" (also called as a "status") allows users to post messages for their friends to read. In turn, friends can respond with their own comments, as well as clicking the "Like" button. A user's most recent updates appear at the top of their Timeline/Wall and are also noted in the "Recently Updated" section of a user's friend list. Originally, the purpose of the feature was to allow users to inform their friends of their current "status", including feelings, whereabouts, or actions, where Facebook prompted the status update with "Username is"... and users filled in the rest. This feature first became available in September 2006, though on December 13, 2007, the requirement to start a status update with is was removed.[107]
The is updates were followed by the "What are you doing right now?" status update question; in March 2009, the question was changed to "What's on your mind?"[108] In 2009, Facebook added the feature to tag certain friends (or groups, etc.) within one's status update by adding an @ character before their name, turning the friend's name into a link to their profile and including the message on the friend's wall. Tagging has since been updated to recognize friends' names by typing them into a status while a list of friends whose names match the inputted letters appears. A large percentage of the updates that are posted are humorous and as a result, many apps, websites and books have sprung up to help users to update their own.
Subscribe[edit]
On September 14, 2011, Facebook launched a Subscribe button. The feature allows users to follow public updates, and these are the people most often broadcasting their ideas.[109] There were major modifications that the site released on September 22, 2011.[110]
Ticker[edit]
In 2011, Facebook launched a ticker that showed all of their friends and pages updates. For example, it shows when their friends comment or like a status, and their status updates as soon as they posted them. If users do not have the chat sidebar open, the ticker appears on Facebook home next to the News Feed. If users do have the chat sidebar open, the ticker appears above the list of friends, and can be re-sized (unless the chat sidebar is open). The ticker cannot be closed, and this has brought up concern among users, especially privacy concerns. However, Facebook has been keen to emphasize that the ticker only shows what people could see before—it just makes it "more discoverable".[111]
URL shortener[edit]
On December 14, 2009, Facebook launched its own URL shortener based on FB.me domain name.[112] From that point on, all links based on facebook.com can be accessed through fb.me, which is seven characters shorter.
Starting June 13, 2009, Facebook introduced a feature that allowed users to choose a Facebook username to make user location easier. The user is able to direct others to their page through a simple link such as www.facebook.com/username rather than an otherwise complex URL. This feature on Facebook quickly spread, with more than 1 million users registering usernames in the first three hours.[113] Usernames are now available to any existing or newly registered user.
According to the FAQ, "Facebook reserves the right to remove and/or reclaim any username at any time for any reason".[114]
Verified Accounts[edit]
As reported by TechCrunch on February 15, 2012, Facebook introduced "Verified Account" concept like those of Twitter and Google+. Verified accounts have blue tick mark and such accounts will get more priority in 'Subscription Suggestions' of Facebook.[115] On May 29, 2013, Facebook rolled out verification feature for prominent celebrities and public figures.
Hash tagging Feature[edit]
On June 12, 2013, Facebook announced in its official blog post that it is introducing clickable hashtags to help users to search the topics which are being discussed over the web easily.[116][117]
"Say Thanks"[edit]
On November 12, 2014, Facebook introduces Say Thanks, an experience that lets user create personalized video greeting cards for friends on Facebook.[118]
Impressum[edit]
Facebook pages run by businesses can display an impressum to allow the business to comply with several European countries' Internet laws.[citation needed]
Call to action button[edit]
Facebook pages run by businesses can display a so-called "call to action button" next to the page's like button. This button allows businesses to link external elements such as their e-store, smartphone app or website.[citation needed]
Security[edit]
On May 12, 2011, Facebook announced that it is launching several new security features[119] designed to protect users from malware and from getting their accounts hijacked.[120]
Facebook will display warnings when users are about to be duped by clickjacking and cross-site scripting attacks in which they think they are following a link to an interesting news story or taking action to see a video and instead end up spamming their friends.[120]
Facebook also offers two-factor authentication called "login approvals", which, if turned on, will require users to enter a code whenever they log into the site from a new or unrecognized device. The code is sent via text message to the user's mobile phone.[120]
Facebook is partnering with the free Web of Trust safe surfing service to give Facebook users more information about the sites they are linking to from the social network. When a user clicks on a potentially malicious link, a warning box will appear that gives more information about why the site might be dangerous. The user can either ignore the warning or go back to the previous page.[120]
Removed features[edit]
FBML[edit]
Facebook Markup Language (FBML) was considered to be Facebook's own version of HTML. While many of the tags of HTML can be used in FBML, there were also important tags that cannot be used such as HTML, HEAD, and BODY. Also, JavaScript cannot be used with FBML.
According to the Facebook Markup Language (FBML) Developer's page, FBML is now deprecated. No new features will be added to FBML and developers are recommended to develop new applications utilizing HTML, JavaScript and CSS. FBML support ended January 1, 2012, and FBML was no longer functioning as of June 1, 2012.
Lite[edit]
In August 2009, Facebook announced the rollout of a "lite" version of the site, optimized for users on slower or intermittent Internet connections. Facebook Lite offered fewer services, excluded most third-party applications and required less bandwidth.[121] A beta version of the slimmed-down interface was released first to invited testers[122] before a broader rollout across users in the United States, Canada, and India.[121] It was announced on April 20, 2010, that support for the "lite" service had ended and that users would be redirected back to the normal, full content, Facebook website. The service was operational for only eight months.
In June 2015, this feature was reintroduced as an app with a total size of less than 1MB, primarily focusing markets where internet access is slow or limited.[123]
Deals[edit]
On April 25, 2011, Facebook announced a pilot program called Deals, which offered online coupons and discounts from local businesses. Facebook initially released Deals as a test in five cities—Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, San Diego, and San Francisco—with the hope of expanding. This new offering was a direct competitor to other social commerce sites such as LivingSocial and Groupon for online coupons and deals-of-the-day. Facebook users were able to use Facebook Credits to purchase vouchers that can be redeemed for real goods and services.[124][125] Facebook has since closed its deal program.

Early life
Kourtney Mary Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California on April 18, 1979, to parents Robert and Kris.[2] She has two younger sisters, Kim and Khloé, and a younger brother, Robert (Rob).[3] After their parents divorced in 1991, Kris remarried to the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner Bruce Jenner (now known as Caitlyn[a]) in 1991.[5] Through their marriage, Kardashian gained stepbrothers Burton "Burt", Brandon, and Brody; stepsister Casey; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie.[6]
She attended Marymount High School, a Roman Catholic all-girls school in Los Angeles. Following graduation, she moved to Dallas, Texas, to attend Southern Methodist University for two years. Kourtney then lived in Tucson, Arizona, where she graduated from the University of Arizona with a bachelor's degree in Theatre Arts and a minor in Spanish. Her classmates included Nicole Richie and Luke Walton.[7] In 1994, her father garnered public attention as an additional defense lawyer for football player O.J. Simpson during his murder trial.
Career
Kourtney first became known to reality-television audiences on the 2005 series, Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive, on which she earned money for charity. In February 2007, a sex tape made by her sister Kim and former boyfriend Ray J in 2003 was leaked, which largely contributed to her rise to prominence.[8][9] Later that year, Kourtney, in addition to her mother Kris; her stepfather Bruce (now known as Caitlyn);[10] her siblings Kim, Khloé, and Rob; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie were commissioned to star in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[11] The series proved successful for E!, the network on which it is broadcast, and lead to several spin-offs, including Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami, Khloé & Lamar, and Kourtney and Kim Take New York .[12]
Kourtney and her mother opened children's clothing boutiques called Smooch in the Los Angeles area and New York City; the boutiques carry the brand Crib Rock Couture. With sisters Kim and Khloe, Kardashian co-owns and operates D-A-S-H, a clothing boutique in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, and a pop-up store in the Hamptons.[7]
In the spring of 2010, Kourtney and her sisters released a clothing line for Bebe.[13][14][15] In August 2010, Kourtney announced that she and her sisters were working on another clothing line called K-Dash, sold on QVC.[16] Kardashian and her sisters created a sunless tanner called Kardashian Glamour Tan in 2010.[17] Kardashian wrote the book Kardashian Konfidential with her sisters Khloe and Kim; it was released in November 2010.[18]
Kourtney made her acting debut with a guest appearance on the ABC soap One Life to Live on March 28, 2011, appearing as attorney Kassandra Kavanaugh.[19] Kardashian, who had grown up watching the soap opera and described her appearance as the realization of a "lifelong dream", had reservations about her acting debut, stating: "I'd thought I'd have two lines. But my script is so long... I'm not an actress."[20][21] Her performance was met with negative reviews from critics.[22] In September 2012, she and younger sister Kim created another spinoff reality television series, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, which began airing in January 2013. It features their mother Kris Jenner and sister Khloé Kardashian.[23]
Kourtney, Khloé, and Kim are spokeswomen for the diet supplement Quick Trim, for weight loss.[24][25] In March 2012 the three sisters were named in a $5 million class-action lawsuit against QuickTrim.[26] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accused the Kardashians, along with QuickTrim's manufacturer Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain, of false and deceptive marketing. The plaintiffs, from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[27]
Kardashian also represents the skincare line PerfectSkin with her sisters, which was developed by Dr. Ron DiSalvo for Perfect Science Labs.[28] The three sisters also released a 20-piece collection of jewelry line for the company Virgins, Saints, and Angels, in March 2010. The jewelry is reflective of the their partial Armenian background.[29]
Personal life




Kardashian and Scott Disick in 2010


Kourtney began dating Scott Disick in 2006, when they met at friend Joe Francis' house party in Mexico.[30] The couple have had an on-again, off-again relationship, all throughout the filming of the show. Kourtney gave birth to their first son, Mason Dash Disick, on December 14, 2009. Mason's birth, by Beverly Hills doctor Paul Crane, was filmed and aired during the 4th season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[31][32]
In early 2010, the couple temporarily moved to Miami with their son and Kourtney's sister Kim. During this time, Kourtney believed Disick had an alcohol problem. After regularly attending therapy and temporarily giving up alcohol, Disick and Kourtney reconciled and they continued their relationship in mid-2010.[33]
In 2011, during the final episode in the first season of Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Disick purchased an engagement ring and planned to propose to Kourtney during an evening meal in New York City. However, when Disick asked Kourtney's opinion on marriage, she responded with "if things are so good now... why would we want to change that?", so he did not propose.[34] On July 8, 2012, Kourtney gave birth to their second child, daughter Penelope Scotland Disick.[35] She was named after Scotland because of Kourtney's Scottish ancestry.[36]
In June 2014, it was announced that the couple were expecting their third child together.[37] Kourtney gave birth on December 14, 2014, to their third child, a son, Reign Aston Disick, which was also on Mason's fifth birthday.[38]
On July 6, 2015, E! News reported the couple's breakup.[39]

Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. The company does not own any lodging; it is merely a broker and receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts in conjunction with every booking.[3][4][5] It has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries,[6] and the cost of lodging is set by the host. Like all hospitality services, Airbnb is a form of collaborative consumption and sharing.

How it works[edit]
Registration and account creation is free.[7] On each booking, the company charges guests a 6%-12% guest services fee and charges hosts a 3% host service fee.[8][9][10][11][12]
Users can search for lodging using a variety of filters including lodging type, dates, location, and price.[13] Before booking, users must provide a valid email address, telephone number, or a scan of a government-issued ID.[14][15]




Airbnb iPhone app screenshot


In addition to the Airbnb website, the company offers mobile applications for iOS, Apple Watch, and Android.[16][17] These offer geolocation and much of the functionality of the website, including private messaging. The mobile apps have received several awards.[18]
Offering lodging[edit]
Users can create a listing by selecting "list your space" after logging in.[19] A listing will not go live until the host is ready to publish.[20] Pricing is determined by the host, with recommendations from Airbnb.[20] Hosts can charge different prices for nightly, weekly, and monthly stays and can make adjustments for seasonal pricing.[20] Hosts add descriptions of the residence, amenities, available dates, cancellation policies, and any house rules[21] and hosts are advised to upload photos of the lodging that is offered.[22] For eligible hosts, Airbnb offers free professional photography.[23] Potential guests are required to message the host directly through Airbnb to ask questions regarding the property. Unless the host has enabled "instant book", in which case requests for stays are accepted automatically, a host has 24 hours to accept or decline a booking.[24][25] After the reservation, hosts coordinate meeting times and contact information with guests.[20]
Legality of offering lodging[edit]
Some cities have restrictions on subletting for a short period of time.[26] In some cities, collection of a transient occupancy tax by Airbnb is required.[26] In many cities, hosts must register with the government and obtain a permit or license.[26] Airbnb has published a list of regulations and requirements by city; however, only cities in the United States are included. In addition, many landlords or community associations also have restrictions on short term sublets.[27] Hosts may be required to pay income taxes on income received via Airbnb and, in the United States, Airbnb sends tax forms to hosts that have earned over $20,000 in rents and received over 200 reservations via Airbnb in a calendar year.[28]
Safety mechanisms[edit]
Airbnb had to overcome the obstacle of "stranger danger" to build a level of trust between hosts and guests and instill confidence in its platform. Airbnb did this by requiring user profiles so that members can learn about their hosts and guests ahead of time and by establishing a rating and review system. Founder Joe Gebbia has said that Airbnb is specifically "designed for trust".[29][30]
References and reviews[edit]
After the guest completes a stay, the host and guest have the option of leaving references for each other and reviews of their stay, which are posted publicly, providing for an online reputation.[31][32][33][34]
Insurance[edit]
Airbnb recommends that hosts obtain insurance which covers damages caused by guests.[35] Airbnb offers secondary insurance, called its "host guarantee".[36] The guarantee covers property loss and damage due to vandalism and theft. When first launched in August 2011, the program covered up to US$50,000.[37] However, the maximum was later increased to US$1,000,000.[38][39] The company also has a 24-hour customer service hotline and a task force to review suspicious activity.[40]
Logged private messaging system[edit]
The site provides a private messaging system as a channel for users to message one another privately before booking and accepting reservations.[41] Hosts are never required to accept a reservation.[42][43]
Secure payments[edit]
Airbnb facilitates online payments from guest to host through its Security Payments feature, which processes payment transactions 24 hours after check-in.[44]
Security deposits and cleaning fees[edit]
At the option of the host, Airbnb facilitates security deposits and mandatory non-refundable cleaning fees, the former of which is held until the property is vacated.[45]
Verification of identity[edit]
Any Airbnb host can require their prospective guests to obtain "Verified IDs" before booking, meaning that they are required to scan a government-issued ID to verify their identity.[46]
Linking to social network accounts[edit]
An Airbnb account can be linked to accounts on social networking services such as Facebook, thus providing the host with data on common friends and interests.[47][48][49]
Wish list feature[edit]
In June 2012, Airbnb launched a wish list feature, offering users the ability to create a curated catalog of desired lodgings that they would like to visit.[50] Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer, Joe Gebbia and his team conceived the idea of changing the website from an online marketplace to a source for inspiration. Users can organise their favorite destinations into organized lists and share these lists with other users.[51]
Neighborhoods travel guide[edit]
"Neighborhoods" is a travel guide that provides in-depth information for selected neighborhoods in 23 major cities through photos, essays, maps, tags from locals, and assessments of various criteria that would be of interests to guests such as public transportation, dining, peace & quiet, nightlife, tourist attractions, and shopping, thereby helping travelers choose the ideal neighborhood to stay in via collaborative filtering.[52][53][54][55] The Airbnb product team hand-mapped hundreds of neighborhoods within these cities and had local editors curate content for each neighborhood. Airbnb also added 70 street photographers who generated 40,000 photographs for the project.[56]
History[edit]




Airbnb founder Joe Gebbia (right)


Shortly after moving to San Francisco in October 2007, roommates and former schoolmates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia could not afford the rent for their loft apartment. Chesky and Gebbia came up with the idea of putting an air mattress in their living room and turning it into a bed and breakfast.[57][58][59] The goal at first was just "to make a few bucks".[60][61] In February 2008, Nathan Blecharczyk, Chesky's former roommate, joined as the Chief Technology Officer and the third co-founder of the new venture, called AirBed & Breakfast.[59][62] They put together a website which offered short-term living quarters, breakfast, and a unique business networking opportunity for those who were unable to book a hotel in the saturated market.[63] The site Airbedandbreakfast.com officially launched on August 11, 2008.[64][65] The founders had their first customers in town in the summer of 2008, during the Industrial Design Conference held by Industrial Designers Society of America, where travelers had a hard time to find lodging in the city.[59][66]
To help fund the site, the founders created special edition breakfast cereals, with presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain as the inspiration for "Obama O's" and "Cap'n McCains".[67] In two months, 800 boxes of cereal were sold at $40 each, which generated more than $30,000 for the company's incubation.[68][69] It also got the company noticed by computer programmer Paul Graham, who invited the founders to the January 2009 winter training session of his prestigious startup incubator, Y Combinator, which provided them with training and $20,000 in funding in exchange for a small interest in the company.[60][70][71] With the website already built, they used the $20,000 Y-Combinator investment to fly to New York City to meet users and promote the site.[72] They returned to San Francisco with a profitable business model to present to West Coast investors. By March 2009, the site had 10,000 users and 2,500 listings.[71]
In March 2009, the name of the company was changed to Airbnb.com, and the site's content had expanded from air beds and shared spaces to a variety of properties including entire homes and apartments, private rooms, castles, boats, manors, tree houses, tipis, igloos, private islands and other properties.[73]
One year later, there were 15 people working from Chesky and Gebbia's loft apartment on Rausch Street in San Francisco. To make room for employees, Brian Chesky gave up his bedroom and lived at lodging booked via the Airbnb service until the company moved into its first office space.,[74][60] and in April 2009, the company received $600,000 in seed money from Sequoia Capital.[60] In November 2010, the company raised $7.2 million in financing from Greylock Partners and again from Sequoia Capital in a Series A round and announced that out of 700,000 nights booked, 80% had occurred in the past six months.[75]
In February 2011, Airbnb announced its 1 millionth booking since its inception in August 2008.[76][77] In January 2012, the company announced its 5 millionth night booked internationally. In June 2012, Airbnb announced 10 million nights booked, doubling business in the previous 5 months.[78][79] Of these bookings, 75% of the business came from markets outside of the continental United States.
On May 25, 2011, actor and partner at A-Grade Investments Ashton Kutcher announced a significant investment in the company and his role as a strategic brand advisor for the company.[80]
In May 2011, Airbnb acquired a German competitor, Accoleo. This takeover, as well as other similar acquisitions, launched the first international Airbnb office, in Hamburg.[81] In October 2011, Airbnb established its second international office in London.[82][83] Due to the growth of international users, in early 2012, Airbnb opened offices in Paris, Milan, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Moscow, and São Paulo.[84] These openings were in addition to existing offices in San Francisco, London, Hamburg, and Berlin.[85] Airbnb announced in September 2013 that its European headquarters would be located in Dublin.[86] Prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics, Airbnb acquired London-based rival CrashPadder, subsequently adding 6,000 international listings to its existing inventory. This acquisition made Airbnb the largest lodging website in the United Kingdom.[87]
In November 2012, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Airbnb partnered with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to offer free housing for persons displaced by the storm.[88] Airbnb built a microsite for this effort alone where victims register for housing and meet property owners with free housing.[89] Additionally, Airbnb waived all service fees associated with these listings while maintaining the Host Guarantee for all properties listed.[90]
In November 2012, Airbnb opened an office in Sydney, Australia, its 11th office location, and announced plans to launch the service in Thailand and Indonesia,[91] At that time, Australian consumers accounted for 10% of the Airbnb user base.[92] and in December that same year, Airbnb announced its strategy to move more aggressively into the Asian market with the launch of an office in Singapore.[93]
In November 2012, Airbnb acquired NabeWise, a city guide that aggregates curated information for specified locations.[94] The acquisition shifted the company focus toward offering hyperlocal recommendations to travelers.[95] In December 2012, Airbnb announced the acquisition of Localmind.[96] Localmind is a location-based question and answer platform that allows users to post questions about specific locations online. These questions are then answered in real-time by experts on the specified territories.[97]
By October 2013, Airbnb had served 9 million guests since its founding in August 2008,[98] and in December 2013, the company reported it had over 6 million new guests in 2013, and nearly 250,000 properties were added in 2013.[99]
In July 2014, Airbnb revealed design revisions to the site and mobile app and introduced a new logo.[100] Some considered the new logo to be visually similar to genitalia,[60][101] but a consumer survey by Survata showed only a minority of respondents thought this was the case.[102]
In April 2015, following the Obama administration's easing of restrictions on U.S. businesses to operate in Cuba, Airbnb expanded to Cuba, making it one of the first U.S. companies to do so.[103][104]
In June 2015, Airbnb sponsored the Manor F1 Team and the Airbnb logo appeared on the front nose of the cars and on team wear including the drivers' overalls.[105]
In August 2015, Airbnb partnered with Tesla Motors to provide chargers at certain host houses, first in California.[106]
In the summer of 2016, the Federal Trade Commission started investigating how Airbnb affected housing costs per the request from three US senators. In October that same year, New York Gov. signed a bill charging Airbnb fines for violations of local housing laws. The New York Times reported that these events were related and part of a "plan that the hotel association started in early 2016 to thwart Airbnb".[107]
In January 2017, Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, tweeted that the company will give free housing to refugees and any others not allowed into the United States as a result of Donald Trump’s Executive Order 13769, which temporarily banned refugees from the United States.[108][109] AirBnB also led an investment in reservation-booking app, Resy, along with serial entrepreneurs Gary Vaynerchuk, Ben Leventhal and Mike Montero.[110]
Airbnb first became profitable during the second half of 2016. Airbnb's revenue grew more than 80% from 2015 to 2016.[111]
In February 2017, Airbnb acquired Luxury Retreats International, a Canadian-based villa rental company, in its largest acquisition to date.[112]

In April 2014, the company closed on an investment of $450 million by TPG Capital at a company valuation of approximately $10 billion.[117] Additional funding was provided by Andreessen Horowtiz, Sequoia Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, T. Rowe Price and Sherpa Capital.[118][119][120]
In March 2015, Airbnb raised funding at a $20 billion company valuation.[121]

In March 2017, Airbnb raised $1 billion in additional funding, bringing their total funding raised to date to more than $3 billion and valuing the company at $31 billion.[124]
Benefits[edit]
Cost savings to guests[edit]
A September 2016 study showed that the cost of renting an entire house via Airbnb was similar to the cost of renting a single room at a hotel.[125]
Additional income to homeowners faced with foreclosure[edit]
Many people who were on the brink of losing their homes through foreclosure due to financial hardship, have come to depend on Airbnb for additional income.[126] In a survey, 53% of hosts said that the additional income from Airbnb has provided them with the financial means to stay in their home.[127]
Lodging options in under-served areas[edit]
74% of listings on Airbnb are outside the main hostel districts, providing lodging to travelers in areas where they would not otherwise find any.[127]
Economic impact[edit]
Studies have shown that Airbnb guests stay 2.1 times longer and spend 2.1 times as much as typical visitors.[127][128]
In November 2012, Airbnb commissioned HR&A Advisors to conduct a study, which measured the market impact of collaborative consumption by users in San Francisco.[129] The study found that from April 2011 to May 2012, guests and hosts using Airbnb contributed $56 million in spending within the San Francisco economy, $43.1 million of which supported local businesses.[130] Over 90% of hosts surveyed rented their primary residences to visitors on an occasional basis, and spent nearly half the income they make on living expenses. The study also found the average guest stay was 5.5 days, compared to 3.5 days for hotel guests, and the average guest spent $1,100, including $360 on lodging, during their stay, compared to the $840 spent by hotel guests.[131]
Sponsorships[edit]
In 2014, Airbnb was the official jersey sponsor for the Australia men's national basketball team at the 2014 Basketball World Cup.[132]
Airbnb has sponsored the New York City Marathon since 2014.[133]
Criticism and controversies[edit]
Fair housing implications and discrimination[edit]
In July 2016, former Attorney General Eric Holder was hired to help craft an anti-discrimination policy for Airbnb after the company faced many complaints related to racism, including a study by Harvard Business School that showed widespread discrimination by hosts against guests whose names suggested that they were black.[134]
Crimes committed by users[edit]
There have been many crimes committed by users, ranging from vandalism committed by guests to sexual assault committed by hosts.[135][136][137]
Privacy and terms of use[edit]
Airbnb's identity verification system "Verified ID"[138] has been perceived by many customers as excessively intrusive.[139][140][141] It requires three layers of customer identification: telephone, photo of ID (such as passport or driver's license), and verification of Facebook, Linkedin or Google+ account.
Linguist Mark Liberman has criticized the extreme length of the legal agreements that Airbnb members are required to accept, with the site's terms of service, privacy policy, and other policies amounting to "55081 words, or about the size of a short novel, though much less readable".[142]
Despite having no explicit ban on hosts filming guests, Airbnb updated its terms of use in November 2014 to require that hosts fully disclose the use of surveillance equipment and security cameras to guests.[143] Previously, no such disclosure was required.[144]
Pricing transparency[edit]
When customers search for lodging, Airbnb displays per-night prices that exclude its own per-night service charges as well as possible additional costs such as cleaning fees. The total price is not revealed until the customer selects an individual property and is ready to book.[145]
In late 2015, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission took action against Airbnb for this form of drip pricing. Consequently, users of Airbnb's Australian web site now see the total price of a stay including all unavoidable charges at every stage of the booking process.[146][147] However, no changes were made to the displayed pricing in other markets.
Boycott over Israeli settlements[edit]
Airbnb is on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions list of companies.[148] The company was added following media reports that lodging listings included settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories that are advertised as being in Israel or in Israeli neighborhoods.[149][150]
Housing affordability[edit]
In San Francisco, protesters accused Airbnb of contributing to rising rental rates, as landlords keep properties off the longer term rental market and instead get higher rental rates for short term housing via Airbnb.[151] However, Proposition F, which would have restricted short term rentals in San Francisco, failed to pass by a vote of 55% opposed compared to 45% in favor.[152]
Tax avoidance[edit]
The company has been accused of avoiding paying taxes by setting up a double Irish arrangement through subsidiaries in Ireland and Jersey.[153][154]
In 2016, the Spanish treasury department sent letters to property owners that have not declared income associated with Airbnb,[155] and in Australia, insiders said in 2016 that the hosts of the 75,000 properties listed on Airbnb would likely face increased chances of being audited.[156]
Awards and accolades[edit]
Airbnb won the "app" award at the 2011 South by Southwest conference.[157]

QR code for the URL of the English Wikipedia Mobile main page


QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response Code) is the trademark for a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed for the automotive industry in Japan. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to efficiently store data; extensions may also be used.[1]
The QR code system became popular outside the automotive industry due to its fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to standard UPC barcodes. Applications include product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.[2]
A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera, and processed using Reed–Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data is then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.[2]

History[edit]
The QR code system was invented in 1994 by Denso Wave. Its purpose was to track vehicles during manufacturing; it was designed to allow high-speed component scanning.[3] QR codes are now used in a much broader context, including both commercial tracking applications and convenience-oriented applications aimed at mobile-phone users (termed mobile tagging). QR codes may be used to display text to the user, to add a vCard contact to the user's device, to open a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), or to compose an email or text message. Users can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use via downloadable or online applications.[citation needed] The technology has since become one of the most used types of two-dimensional barcode.[4]
Standards[edit]




Structure of a QR code, highlighting functional elements


There are several standards that cover the encoding of data as QR codes:[5]

October 1997 – AIM (Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility) International[6]
January 1999 – JIS X 0510
June 2000 – ISO/IEC 18004:2000 Information technology – Automatic identification and data capture techniques – Bar code symbology – QR code (now withdrawn)
Defines QR code models 1 and 2 symbols.
1 September 2006 – ISO/IEC 18004:2006 Information technology – Automatic identification and data capture techniques – QR code 2005 bar code symbology specification (now withdrawn)[7]
Defines QR code 2005 symbols, an extension of QR code model 2. Does not specify how to read QR code model 1 symbols, or require this for compliance.
1 February 2015 – ISO/IEC 18004:2015 Information – Automatic identification and data capture techniques – QR Code barcode symbology specification
Renames the QR Code 2005 symbol to QR Code and adds clarification to some procedures and minor corrections.

At the application layer, there is some variation between most of the implementations. Japan's NTT DoCoMo has established de facto standards for the encoding of URLs, contact information, and several other data types.[8] The open-source "ZXing" project maintains a list of QR code data types.[9]
Uses[edit]




A QR code used on a large billboard in Japan, linking to the sagasou.mobi website


QR codes have become common in consumer advertising. Typically, a smartphone is used as a QR code scanner, displaying the code and converting it to some useful form (such as a standard URL for a website, thereby obviating the need for a user to type it into a web browser). QR code has become a focus of advertising strategy, since it provides a way to access a brand's website more quickly than by manually entering a URL.[10][11] Beyond mere convenience to the consumer, the importance of this capability is that it increases the conversion rate (the chance that contact with the advertisement will convert to a sale), by coaxing interested prospects further down the conversion funnel with little delay or effort, bringing the viewer to the advertiser's website immediately, where a longer and more targeted sales pitch may lose the viewer's interest.
Although initially used to track parts in vehicle manufacturing, QR codes are used over a much wider range of applications, including commercial tracking, entertainment and transport ticketing, product and loyalty marketing (examples: mobile couponing where a company's discounted and percent discount can be captured using a QR code decoder which is a mobile app, or storing a company's information such as address and related information alongside its alpha-numeric text data as can be seen in Yellow Pages directory), and in-store product labeling. It can also be used in storing personal information for use by organizations. An example of this is Philippines National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) where NBI clearances now come with a QR code. Many of these applications target mobile-phone users (via mobile tagging). Users may receive text, add a vCard contact to their device, open a URI, or compose an e-mail or text message after scanning QR codes. They can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by visiting one of several pay or free QR code-generating sites or apps. Google had an API, now deprecated, to generate QR codes,[12] and apps for scanning QR codes can be found on nearly all smartphone devices.[13]
QR codes storing addresses and URLs may appear in magazines, on signs, on buses, on business cards, or on almost any object about which users might want information. Users with a camera phone equipped with the correct reader application can scan the image of the QR code to display text, contact information, connect to a wireless network, or open a web page in the telephone's browser. This act of linking from physical world objects is termed hardlinking or object hyperlinking. QR codes also may be linked to a location to track where a code has been scanned. Either the application that scans the QR code retrieves the geo information by using GPS and cell tower triangulation (aGPS) or the URL encoded in the QR code itself is associated with a location.[14]




QR codes have been used and printed on train tickets in China since 2010.[15]


Recruiters have started placing QR codes in job advertisements,[16] while applicants have started sporting it in their CVs and visiting cards.[16]
In June 2011 The Royal Dutch Mint (Koninklijke Nederlandse Munt) issued the world's first official coin with a QR code to celebrate the centenary of its current building and premises. The coin can be scanned by a smartphone and link to a special website with contents about the historical event and design of the coin.[17] In 2014 the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a 100-naira banknote to commemorate its centennial, the first banknote to incorporate a QR code in its design. When scanned with an internet-enabled mobile device, the code goes to a website which tells the centenary story of Nigeria.[18] In 2015, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation issued a 100-rubles note to commemorate the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. It contains a QR code into its design, and when scanned with an internet-enabled mobile device, the code goes to a website that details the historical and technical background of the commemorative note. In 2017, the Bank of Ghana issued a 5-cedis banknote to commemorate 60 years of Central Banking in Ghana, and contains a QR code in its design, which when scanned with an internet-enabled mobile device, that code goes to the official Bank of Ghana website. In 2008, a Japanese stonemason announced plans to engrave QR codes on gravestones, allowing visitors to view information about the deceased, and family members to keep track of visits.[19]
Psychologist Richard Wiseman was one of the first authors to include QR codes in a book, in Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There (2011), allowing his readers to follow up on paranormal claims by accessing his research through the codes.[20]
On February 20, 2016, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will[needs update] launch the eponymously named IndiaQR, a common QR code jointly developed by all the four major card payment companies - National Payments Corporation of India that runs RuPay cards along with MasterCard, Visa and American Express. It will also have the capability of accepting payments on the unified payments interface (UPI) platform.[21][22]
Mobile operating systems[edit]
QR codes can be used on various mobile device operating systems. These devices support URL redirection, which allows QR codes to send metadata to existing applications on the device. Many paid or free apps are available with the ability to scan the codes and hard-link to an external URL.
URLs[edit]
URLs aided marketing conversion rates even in the pre-smartphone era, but during those years faced several limitations: ad viewers usually had to type the URL and often did not have a web browser in front of them when they first viewed the ad. The chances were high that they would forget to visit the site later, not bother to type a URL, or forget what URL to type. Semantic URLs decreased these risks but did not eliminate them. Some of these disadvantages to URL conversion rates are fading away now that smartphones are putting web access and voice recognition in constant reach, with QR code providing the URL for instant access.
Virtual stores[edit]
During the month of June 2011, according to one study, 14 million mobile users scanned a QR code or a barcode. Some 58% of those users scanned a QR or barcode from their homes, while 39% scanned from retail stores; 53% of the 14 million users were men between the ages of 18 and 34.[23] The use of QR codes for "virtual store" formats started in South Korea,[24] and Argentina,[25] but is currently expanding globally.[26] Walmart, Procter & Gamble and Woolworths have already adopted the Virtual Store concept.[27]
Code payments[edit]
QR codes can be used to store bank account information or credit card information, or they can be specifically designed to work with particular payment provider applications. There are several trial applications of QR code payments across the world.[28][29]
In November 2012, QR code payments were deployed on a larger scale in the Czech Republic when an open format for payment information exchange - a Short Payment Descriptor - was introduced and endorsed by the Czech Banking Association as the official local solution for QR payments.[30]
QR codes are commonly used in the field of cryptographic currencies, particularly those based on and including Bitcoin.[31] Payment addresses, cryptographic keys and transaction information are often shared between digital wallets in this way.[32]
Website login[edit]
QR codes can be used to log in into websites: a QR code is shown on the login page on a computer screen, and when a registered user scans it with a verified smartphone, they will automatically be logged in. Authentication is performed by the smartphone which contacts the server. Google tested such a login method in January 2012.[33]
Funerary use[edit]
In 2008, Ishinokoe in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan began to sell tombstones with QR codes produced by IT DeSign, where the code leads to a virtual grave site of the deceased.[34][35][36] Other companies, such as Wisconsin based Interactive Headstones, have begun implementing QR codes into tombstones.[37] In 2014 the Jewish Cemetery of La Paz in Uruguay, began implementing QR codes for tombstones.[38]
Encryption[edit]




Japanese immigration stamp with a QR code (content is encrypted)


Encrypted QR codes, which are not very common, have a few implementations. An Android app,[39] for example, manages encryption and decryption of QR codes using the Data Encryption Standard algorithm.[40] The Japanese immigration system uses encrypted QR codes on landing permission stamps in passports[41][42] as shown in the figure to the right.
Video Games[edit]
Popular video games, such as Fez and The Talos Principle, have incorporated QR codes as story and/or gameplay elements.[43][44]
Design[edit]
Unlike the older, one-dimensional barcodes that were designed to be mechanically scanned by a narrow beam of light, a QR code is detected by a 2-dimensional digital image sensor and then digitally analyzed by a programmed processor. The processor locates the three distinctive squares at the corners of the QR code image, using a smaller square (or multiple squares) near the fourth corner to normalize the image for size, orientation, and angle of viewing. The small dots throughout the QR code are then converted to binary numbers and validated with an error-correcting algorithm.
Storage[edit]
The amount of data that can be stored in the QR code symbol depends on the datatype (mode, or input character set), version (1, …, 40, indicating the overall dimensions of the symbol), and error correction level. The maximum storage capacities occur for 40-L symbols (version 40, error correction level L):[4][45]

Error correction[edit]




Damaged but still decodable QR code, Link to http://en.m.wikipedia.org






Example of a QR code with artistic embellishment that will still scan correctly thanks to error correction


Codewords are 8 bits long and use the Reed–Solomon error correction algorithm with four error correction levels. The higher the error correction level, the less storage capacity. The following table lists the approximate error correction capability at each of the four levels:


Level L (Low)
7% of codewords can be restored.


Level M (Medium)
15% of codewords can be restored.


Level Q (Quartile)[46]
25% of codewords can be restored.


Level H (High)
30% of codewords can be restored.


In larger QR symbols, the message is broken up into several Reed–Solomon code blocks. The block size is chosen so that at most 15 errors can be corrected in each block; this limits the complexity of the decoding algorithm. The code blocks are then interleaved together, making it less likely that localized damage to a QR symbol will overwhelm the capacity of any single block.
Due to error correction, it is possible to create artistic QR codes that still scan correctly, but contain intentional errors to make them more readable or attractive to the human eye, as well as to incorporate colors, logos, and other features into the QR code block.[47][48]
It is also possible to design artistic QR codes without reducing the error correction capacity by manipulating the underlying mathematical constructs.[49][50]
Encoding[edit]
The format information records two things: the error correction level and the mask pattern used for the symbol. Masking is used to break up patterns in the data area that might confuse a scanner, such as large blank areas or misleading features that look like the locator marks. The mask patterns are defined on a grid that is repeated as necessary to cover the whole symbol. Modules corresponding to the dark areas of the mask are inverted. The format information is protected from errors with a BCH code, and two complete copies are included in each QR symbol.[2]
The message dataset is placed from right to left in a zigzag pattern, as shown below. In larger symbols, this is complicated by the presence of the alignment patterns and the use of multiple interleaved error-correction blocks.

The general structure of a QR encoding is as a sequence of 4 bit indicators with payload length dependent on the indicator mode (e.g. byte encoding payload length is dependent on the first byte).[51]

Note:

Character Count Indicator depends on how many modules are in a QR code (Symbol Version).
ECI Assignment number Size:

8 × 1 bits if ECI Assignement Bitstream starts with '0'
8 × 2 bits if ECI Assignement Bitstream starts with '10'
8 × 3 bits if ECI Assignement Bitstream starts with '110'





Four-bit indicators are used to select the encoding mode and convey other information.

Encoding modes

0010
Alphanumeric encoding (11 bits per 2 characters)


0100
Byte encoding (8 bits per character)


1000
Kanji encoding (13 bits per character)


0011
Structured append (used to split a message across multiple QR symbols)


0111

0101
FNC1 in first position (see Code 128 for more information)


1001
FNC1 in second position


0000
End of message (Terminator)


Encoding modes can be mixed as needed within a QR symbol. (e.g., a url with a long string of alphanumeric characters )


[ Mode Indicator][ Mode bitstream ] --> [ Mode Indicator][ Mode bitstream ] --> etc... --> [ 0000 End of message (Terminator) ]

After every indicator that selects an encoding mode is a length field that tells how many characters are encoded in that mode. The number of bits in the length field depends on the encoding and the symbol version.

Alphanumeric encoding mode stores a message more compactly than the byte mode can, but cannot store lower-case letters and has only a limited selection of punctuation marks, which are sufficient for rudimentary web addresses. Two characters are coded in an 11-bit value by this formula:

V = 45 × C1 + C2

Variants[edit]
Micro QR code is a smaller version of the QR code standard for applications where symbol size is limited. There are four different versions (sizes) of Micro QR codes: the smallest is 11×11 modules; the largest can hold 35 numeric characters.[52]
IQR code is an alternative to existing QR codes developed by Denso Wave. IQR codes can be created in square or rectangular formations; this is intended for situations where a rectangular barcode would otherwise be more appropriate, such as cylindrical objects. IQR codes can fit the same amount of information in 30% less space. There are 61 versions of square IQR codes, and 15 versions of rectangular codes. For squares, the minimum size is 9x9 modules; rectangles have a minimum of 19x5 modules. IQR codes add error correction level S, which allows for 50% error correction.[53] IQR Codes have not yet been given an ISO specification, and only proprietary Denso Wave products can create or read IQR codes.[54]
Model 1 QR code is an older version of the specification. It is visually similar to the widely seen model 2 codes, but lacks alignment patterns.

License[edit]
The use of QR Code technology is freely licensed as long as users follow the standards for QR Code documented with JIS or ISO. Non-standardized codes may require special licensing.[55]
Denso Wave owns a number of patents on QR Code technology, but has chosen to exercise them in a limited fashion.[55] In order to promote widespread usage of the technology Denso Wave chose to waive its rights to a key patent in its possession for standardized codes only.[5] In the USA, the granted QR Code patent is US 5726435 , and in Japan JP 2938338 . The European Patent Office granted patent "EPO 0672994".  to Denso Wave, which was then validated into French, UK, and German patents, all of which expired in March 2015. [56]
The text QR Code itself is a registered trademark and wordmark of Denso Wave Incorporated.[57] In UK, the trademark is registered as E921775, the word "QR Code", with a filing date of 03/09/1998.[58] The UK version of the trademark is based on the Kabushiki Kaisha Denso (DENSO CORPORATION) trademark, filed as Trademark 000921775, the word "QR Code", on 03/09/1998 and registered on 6/12/1999 with the European Union OHIM (Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market).[59] The U.S. Trademark for the word "QR Code" is Trademark 2435991 and was filed on 29 September 1998 with an amended registration date of 13 March 2001, assigned to Denso Corporation.[60]
Risks[edit]
The only context in which common QR codes can carry executable data is the URL data type. These URLs may host JavaScript code, which can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in applications on the host system, such as the reader, the web browser or the image viewer, since a reader will typically send the data to the application associated with the data type used by the QR code.
In the case of no software exploits, malicious QR codes combined with a permissive reader can still put a computer's contents and user's privacy at risk. This practice is known as "attagging", a portmanteau of "attack tagging".[61] They are easily created and can be affixed over legitimate QR codes.[62] On a smartphone, the reader's permissions may allow use of the camera, full Internet access, read/write contact data, GPS, read browser history, read/write local storage, and global system changes.[63][64][65]
Risks include linking to dangerous web sites with browser exploits, enabling the microphone/camera/GPS, and then streaming those feeds to a remote server, analysis of sensitive data (passwords, files, contacts, transactions),[66] and sending email/SMS/IM messages or DDOS packets as part of a botnet, corrupting privacy settings, stealing identity,[67] and even containing malicious logic themselves such as JavaScript[68] or a virus.[69][70] These actions could occur in the background while the user is only seeing the reader opening a seemingly harmless web page.[71] In Russia, a malicious QR code caused phones that scanned it to send premium texts at a fee of US$6 each.[61]
Extension[edit]




Samples of the High Capacity Colored 2-Dimensional (HCC2D) code: (a) 4-color HCC2D code and (b) 8-color HCC2D code.


Researchers have proposed a new High Capacity Colored 2-Dimensional (HCC2D) Code, which builds upon a QR code basis for preserving the QR robustness to distortions and use colors for increasing data density (at this stage it is still in prototyping phase). The HCC2D code specification is described in details in Querini et al. (2014),[72] while techniques for color classification of HCC2D code cells are described in detail in Querini and Italiano (2014),[73] which is an extended version of Querini and Italiano (2013).[74]
Introducing colors into QR codes requires addressing additional issues. In particular, during QR code reading only the brightness information is taken into account, while HCC2D codes have to cope with chromatic distortions during the decoding phase. In order to ensure adaptation to chromatic distortions which arise in each scanned code, HCC2D codes make use of an additional field: the Color Palette Pattern. This is because color cells of a Color Palette Pattern are supposed to be distorted in the same way as color cells of the Encoding Region. Replicated color palettes are used for training machine learning classifiers.

 Ейрбіенбі на Вікісховищі


Airbnb (читається як «ейрбіенбі») — онлайн-сервіс з розміщення, пошуку та короткострокової оренди житла по всьому світі, що працює за парадигмою економіки спільної участі. Назва розшифровується як «AirBed and Breakfast» — «Надувний матрац та сніданок». Сервіс допомагає винайняти будинки, квартири, кімнати або ліжка у більш ніж 190 країнах світу.
Принцип роботи[ред. • ред. код]
Після реєстрації на сайті користувачі мають можливість здати своє житло за певну ціну, Airbnb бере собі певний відсоток від цієї суми. Таким чином і відбувається монетизація ресурсу.
Історія[ред. • ред. код]
Ідея сервісу народилася у 2007 році. Двоє молодих дизайнерів Браян Ческі та Джо Гебіа винаймали квартиру в Сан-Франциско. В цей час у місті проходила дизайнерська конференція, а у мешканців були проблеми із оплатою проживання. Тож вони придумали здавати спальні місця на надувних матрацах на підлозі, разом із цим вони пропонували клієнтам сніданок. Сервіс був спрямований на тих людей, які не могли собі дозволити проживання в готелі.
Згодом до засновників компанії приєднався програміст Нейтан Блечарзик, який вже в серпні 2008 запустив сайт airbedandbreakfast.com.
Для того, щоб залучити додаткові кошти на розвиток сервісу в другій половині 2008 Браян та Джо придумали продавати злакові пластівці з зображенням Барака Обами та Джона МакКейна на коробках. За 2 місяці вони продали 800 коробок по $40 кожна, залучивши таким чином більш ніж $30000 капіталу для їх компанії. Такими діями вони привернули увагу інкубатору стартапів Y-Combinator, який і зробив перші інвестиції в компанію.
За участі Y-Combinator функціонал сервісу розширився: замість оренди матраців сайт тепер пропонував широкий вибір послуг — з початку 2009 можна було винайняти або здати кімнати, замки, яхти та навіть приватні острови. Також адреса змінилася на airbnb.com.
Сервіс почав стрімко розвиватися, в листопаді 2010 отримав інвестиції в розмірі 7 мільйонів доларів, і у лютому 2011 оголосив досягнення позначки в 1 мільйон бронювань. Влітку 2011 компанія залучила ще 112 мільйонів доларів, а за рік оголосила про своє 10-тимільйонне бронювання. В період залучення цих інвестицій компанія активно викупала менші схожі сервіси по всьому світу.
